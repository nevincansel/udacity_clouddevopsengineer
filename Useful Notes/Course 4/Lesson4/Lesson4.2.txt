Continuous Deployment
Continuous Deployment can be an incredible tool in your arsenal. Not only does CD save time, but it opens some unexpected doors that have a ripple effect over the entire organization. Let's take a look at where CD fits into the overall Software Development Lifecycle.

Where does CD fit in the SDLC?
While CI is all about code, CD is all about the deployment of the artifact.
CI produces the artifact, whether it's a docker image, a zip file, or an executable.
CD Validates the artifact, builds the infrastructure needed to run it, and sets the artifact in motion.
CD affects earlier stages of development over time because team members see quick deployments and begin slicing features into smaller pieces to take advantage.

What will I need to add CD?
Buy in from decision-makers.
Automation skills, which you are learning in this course.
Access to servers or cloud resources.
Time to build automation.

What will I lose when I add CD?
The ability to tinker with the servers manually.
The opaque wall of secrecy around one dev's way of deploying.
Free pizza from the deployment all-nighters.

What will I gain when I have CD?
Automated deployments to QA, Staging, Prod.
More time to develop features.
Generate more confidence amongst stakeholders.
