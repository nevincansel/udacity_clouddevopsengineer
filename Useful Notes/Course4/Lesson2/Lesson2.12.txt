Build Stages
Think of stages like categories or types of jobs. Stages are used to group jobs and control timing.

Stage	    Description
Build	    Everything that has to do with making code executable in production (e.g. Compile). The goal is to produce an artifact.
Test	    All automated tests that verify at the code level.
Analyze	    Any static analysis on the code or checking of dependencies.
Deploy	    Anything to do with creating server instances or copying pre-built application files to an instance.
Verify	    Any tests that can be run against a running instance of the application, often against a pre-production instance.
Promote	    Replacing the current production environment with the new version which was just built and deployed.
Revert	    Rolling back or undoing changes in case any verification fails after deployment.
