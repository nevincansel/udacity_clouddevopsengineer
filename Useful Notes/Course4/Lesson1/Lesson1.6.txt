Expect collaborative, comprehensive grooming of features that include team and stakeholders
Ruthless slicing of features to smallest valuable increments
Build team-wide, deep understanding of each feature's requirements and characteristics before coding starts
Write comprehensive automated unit tests in front-end and back-end layers
Shoot for high coverage from automated back-end integration tests
Shoot for high feature critical-path coverage from end-to-end UI tests
Include automated smoke tests that can be run on production-candidates
Ensure all post-commit tasks and hand-offs must be automated in CI/CD
Strive for quick, reliable rollback if smoke tests fail
